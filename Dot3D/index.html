<!--  November 16, 2016  -->

<!--  This is a mini project that was inspired by a .gif that can be found at the link here: https://github.com/mionick/Dot3D/blob/master/original.gif?raw=true	
			There's also an html element that points to this but is not displayed by default.

			I do not know the source of the original, I found it a couple years ago and have had it saved on my hard drive ever since. 

			I DO NOT take credit of the original image or concept. All I've done is reimplement it using javascript and canvas. No infringment intended and I will gladly credit the original author should they ever become apparent. 

		 	I saw it and wanted to make my own version so that I could use it as a background for an udpdated portfolio website.
		  	I used Easel.js because I wanted a framework to take care of timing the animation loop for me, but the actual rendering is done with pure js/canvas. 

			I tried to make the code as general as possible throughout development so that changing small things like the nummber of dots or the speed was just a parameter change instead of rewriting a block of code.

			Will take a t |  0 < t < 1 and return a percent representing how far along the dot should be.

			My previous attempts used velocity, but I found that the dots rapidly became out of sync. 
			I thought this was likely due to rapidly accruing rounding errors, and it was going to cause problems when I tried to vary the speed anyways, so I changed my tactic.

			Now the positions of the dots are set according to this function. 

			The only guarantee this function has to make is that:
			distance(0) = 0;
			distance(1) = 1;

			0 < distance(t) < 1 for all 0 < t < 1;

			This allows us to vary the "Speed" at which the dots approach the end points.
			I've used a cosine here so the the fastest speed happens when the dot is in the centre of it's initial and final position.

			Was also considering using t^2 or another polynomial, but this is the smoothest approach.
