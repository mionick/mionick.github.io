# Dots
##### Nicholas Mio 
##### November 16, 2016  

This is a mini project that was inspired by a .gif that can be found at the link [here.](https://github.com/mionick/Dot3D/blob/master/original.gif?raw=true)
There's also an html element that points to this but is not displayed by default.

I do not know the source of the original, I found it a couple years ago and have had it saved on my hard drive ever since. 

I DO NOT take credit fo the original image or concept. All I've done is re-implemented it using javascript and canvas. No infringment intended and I will gladly credit the original author should they ever become apparent. 

I saw it and wanted to make my own version so that I could use it as a background for an udpdated portfolio website.
I used Easel.js because I wanted a framework to take care of timing the animation loop for me, but the actual rendering is done with pure js/canvas. 

I tried to make the code as general as possible throughout development so that changing small things like the number of dots or the speed was just a parameter change instead of rewriting a block of code. This actually proved to be really difficult, because the dots would become out of sync or the pattern would break in certain situations.
